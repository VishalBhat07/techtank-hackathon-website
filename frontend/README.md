# Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a React project using Vite, a fast build tool.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** (Recommended version 16 or later) You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm or yarn or pnpm:** Node.js usually comes with npm. yarn or pnpm are alternative package managers.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**

    If you are using a existing repository, clone it using git:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

    If you want to start a new project from scratch, skip this step.

2.  **Create a new Vite React project (if starting from scratch):**
    If you are not using an existing repository, run the following command to create a new Vite React project:

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
    cd my-react-app
    ```

    Replace `my-react-app` with your desired project name.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and install the project dependencies.

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server:**

    Run the following command to start the development server:

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can access your React application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port specified by Vite).

5.  **Understanding the Project Structure:**

    * `public/`: Contains static assets like `index.html` and images.
    * `src/`: Contains the React application's source code.
        * `main.jsx` (or `.tsx`): The entry point of your application.
        * `App.jsx` (or `.tsx`): The main component of your application.
        * `assets/`: For images, stylesheets, or other static assets used by your code.
        * `components/`: A good place to store your React components.
    * `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
    * `vite.config.js` (or `.ts`): Vite configuration file.
    * `index.html`: The HTML file that loads your React application.
    * `node_modules/`: Where all the installed packages are located. (This folder is usually not committed to version control).
    * `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

6.  **Building for Production:**

    When you're ready to deploy your application, run the following command to create a production build:

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `dist/` directory containing the optimized production build of your application.

7.  **Serving the Production Build:**

    You can preview the production build locally using:

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
